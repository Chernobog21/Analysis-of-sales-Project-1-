# Analysis of sales (Project 1)

This is my first data project. The main goals were:
- Data cleaning
- Creating basic business metrics
- Visualization of metrics
- Generating some business advice based on the data.

The following tools were used:
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- CSV datasets

The dataset consists of sales records with information on:
Region, Country, Item Type, Sales Channel, Order Priority, Order Date, Order ID,
Ship Date, Units Sold, Unit Price, Unit Cost, Total Revenue, Total Cost, Total Profit. The dataset was sourced from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anairamcosta/sales-csv?resource=download].

Overall, the project was initially more of an educational effort to try out working with CSV data. 
However, during the project, I acquired skills that will be useful in future real-world work, such as visualization, data cleaning, initial inspection, and the basic principles of analyzing this type of dataset.
